# RNA-seq analysis pipeline

This RNA-seq analysis pipeline is designed for Brent lab, Washington University. The intention of use is process data obtained from (TF-encoding) gene perturbation, time series, and/or multi-level environmental treatment/stimulation experiments. It includes modules (1) pre-alignment sample QC, (2) RNA-seq reads alignment, (3) transcriptome expression analysis, (4) post-alignment QC, (5) sample quality audit, and (6) differential expression (DE) analysis. Its optional modules provide more thorough quality analysis and help guide future experimental design. The pipeline aim at minimizing human effort in metadata maintenance, sample quality assessment and DE design, while maximizing the versatility in handling complex experiment design.
